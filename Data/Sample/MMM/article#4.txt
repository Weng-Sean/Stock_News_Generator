 3M (MMM) is trying to put the country’s largest-ever mass tort case behind it. Even if it does, its
 problems are far from over.The Minnesota conglomerate announced Tuesday it had agreed with
 attorneys to a $6 billion settlement that would end thousands of lawsuits from more than 260,000
 alleging earplugs made by a subsidiary caused hearing loss.3M would make the payments between 2023
 2029, splitting it between $5 billion in cash and $1 billion in stock, so long as the equity
 is approved by the court.Payments would trigger based on the number of claimants who agree to
 in the agreement, with 98% participation required for full payment. The total settlement is less
 $10 billion that analysts projected.The potential resolution comes just two months after 3M reached
 separate tentative settlement over a bulk of claims alleging its so-called forever chemicals
 public drinking water. That pact could require it to pay $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion.On a call
 analysts Tuesday, 3M's chief legal affairs officer Kevin Rhodes said the company had resolved
 to the accord raised by a group of state attorneys general.Its stock rose more than 5% Monday
 a report about the new earplug settlement and was up another 2% Tuesday morning in early trading
 the official announcement.3M said Tuesday that "this agreement is not an admission of liability,"
 that "the products at issue in this litigation are safe and effective when used properly." It also
 is "prepared to continue to defend itself in the litigation if certain agreed terms of the
 agreement are not fulfilled."The company has been trying to show movement in efforts to resolve a
 of litigation dragging down its shares. Year to date, its stock is down roughly 15%. In July it
 a quarterly loss due largely to a charge associated with the forever chemicals settlement."We don’t
 the overhang on the stock and we want to manage it, but we’ve got to, as we move forward, do what’s
 the best interest of the company for the long term," chief executive Mike Roman told analysts in
 own filings make it clear the company has more work to do on the legal front. Here is a look at
 it still faces:According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), studies
 certain PFAS exposure is associated with increased risk for kidney and testicular cancer, fertility
 pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia, fetal and child development changes, liver damage,
 disease, asthma, heightened cholesterol, and immune system changes.These forever chemicals got
 name because they don’t break down in the environment; they were widely used for decades in
 from nonstick cookware to firefighting foam. The claimants who were part of the settlement
 in June alleged injuries from a PFAS fire suppressant product manufactured by 3M called aqueous
 forming foam (AFFF). But outside of that settlement, there are suits from other people, states,
 and governments in other countries alleging personal injuries and property claims from firefighting
 as well as injuries caused by other products: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane
 acid (PFOS)."It'd be premature at this point to talk about, you know, how those [cases] might be
 or when. But what we can say is that we'll continue to address the remainder of the PFAS docket by
 ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions," he said.The company said in its annual
 that it also faces cases alleging that it, and other defendants, failed to warn customers of
 hazards posed by the chemicals.At the time of 3M’s annual report, the cases included 40 individual
 in New York state, as well as cases in Michigan, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Delaware, New
 South Carolina, Massachusetts, Maine, and Ohio.3M said in its filing that as of Dec. 31 there were
 actions pending in Belgian civil courts against the company's subsidiary, 3M Belgium, and the
 government had taken action to force the company to perform remediation at its Zwijndrecht
 Netherlands government was separately investigating potential claims of PFAS contamination in a
 that flows between the country and Belgium.3M has for decades defended lawsuits from plaintiffs
 the US that allege use of its masks and respirators led to workplace asbestos, silica, and coal
 dust exposures.In 2022, mask case costs totaled $67 million for legal defense and settlements. 3M
 as of that date it had recovered $4 million through insurance claims.Global regulators, including
 the US and European Union, are taking steps to reduce acceptable levels of PFAS in drinking
 such activity continues and regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs
 comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement
 3M said in its annual report.3M said last year it would stop making the forever chemicals and work
