 - 3M (MMM.N) on Tuesday secured preliminary approval for a $10.3 billion deal resolving claims by
 public water providers that the company polluted drinking water with toxic chemicals, less than a
 after a group of 22 U.S. states and territories dropped their objections to the deal.U.S. District
 Richard Gergel in Charleston, South Carolina, said in a court filing that the settlement of
 of lawsuits against the Minnesota-based company over pollution by perfluoroalkyl and
 substances, or PFAS, is "sufficiently fair, reasonable and adequate" to justify moving forward.Paul
 an attorney for the water providers, called the preliminary approval a "pivotal moment in our
 efforts to ensure safe and clean drinking water."A 3M spokesperson said the agreement will benefit
 public water systems that provide water to "a vast majority of Americans" without further
 settlement will be considered during a final "fairness hearing" in February, when the judge will
 any outstanding objections or concerns before deciding whether to give final approval.Dubbed
 chemicals" because they do not easily break down, PFAS are used in a range of products from
 foam to non-stick cookware and have been linked to cancer and hormonal dysfunction.The settlement
 in June would provide funds to cities, towns and other public water providers over a 13-year period
 test for and treat PFAS contamination.It stems from litigation over firefighting foams containing
 that were sprayed in fields or airports and left to seep into groundwater and other waterways.The
 had objected in July, saying the deal did not adequately account for the damage caused by PFAS and
 not give water providers enough information to understand whether the settlement was suitable or
 preliminary approval came hours after the states withdrew those objections on Monday night, citing
 to the deal following weeks of negotiations.3M, the water providers and the states said in a joint
 filing that the changes allow individual water providers to obtain estimates on their expected
 before agreeing to the deal, give providers more time to decide whether to opt out of the deal, and
 that states can still pursue separate lawsuits over PFAS contamination.New York Attorney General
 James, whose office originally objected to the deal, said in a statement on Tuesday that the "new
 will ensure 3M is held accountable."Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the
